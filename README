A few scripts and files to aid in using linux. At present I have included;

#1. A bash script to build and install alsaequal in linux.
(I made this in 2011 for Ubuntu which didn't have alsaequal in it's repo at the time. I believe it should be
included in pretty much every distro's repo now, so check that. I doubt you'll be needing this.)

#2. A syntax-highlighting nanorc for the editor 'nano'. I couldn't find one, so I made this.
